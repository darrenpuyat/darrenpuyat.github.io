#### My third personal project, I wanted to create a site where I can show case the projects I
#### have built so far.

#### I built this by following JS Mastery's youtube tutorial here:
#### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fYi8SGA20k

#### This was my first time using React framework. In hindsight, I'll admit I may not have
#### been ready for this, but I persevered, did my best to look up documentation on some of
#### the things I didn't full understand, and while I didn't get every single thing the first
#### around, I did learn a lot.

#### Aside from modifying parts to fit my own personal experience, I modified and cut some
#### parts out, and put temporary work arounds in place, like cutting out the entire technology
#### section. I learnt that I was rendering multiple canvasses per 3d object, instead of having
#### all the 3d objects in one canvas. This was causing parts of the page to not fully load
#### when viewing on mobile.

#### There were a few other issues that I had to troubleshoot that weren't in the video, such
#### as outdated libraries/modules.

#### This was my first foray into React, and won't be my last.
